TylerB's Shipment E2 Functions (v1)
==============

These functions were originally written for my friend, CanadianBill, as a request.

This can be downloaded via [Steam Workshop](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=217722743).

Ever wanted to make an "intelligent" gun shop? With this addon, you can do many cool things:

ent:shipmentName() - Returns the name of the weapon. Something like "Pump shotgun". 
ent:shipmentType() - Returns the class of the weapon inside. Something like "weapon_ak47". 
ent:shipmentPrice() - Returns the price of the shipment, self explanatory. 
ent:shipmentAmount() - Returns the number of weapons still inside. 
ent:shipmentModel() - Returns the model of the weapon. 
ent:isShipment() - Returns whether the entity is a shipment or not.

Goes well with my [moneyRequest() - E2 Functions for DarkRP](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=217722743&tscn=1400930461) addon.
